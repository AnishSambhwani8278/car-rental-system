# ðŸš— Car Rental System (Java OOP-Based) ðŸš—

Welcome to the **Car Rental System** project! This is a console-based application built in **Java** using core **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** principles. The system effectively manages car bookings, returns, and availability status, providing an efficient solution for handling rental operations.

## ðŸ’¡ Key Features:

- **ðŸš˜ Car Booking:** Rent a car from the available list with ease.
- **ðŸ”„ Car Return:** Seamlessly return rented cars.
- **ðŸ“‹ Real-Time Car Status:** View the full list of cars (both rented and available) with updated availability statuses.
- **ðŸ‘¤ Customer Tracking:** Track the customerâ€™s name for each rental to maintain a history of bookings.

## ðŸ”‘ OOP Concepts Implemented:

- **Encapsulation:**  
  The `Car` class encapsulates vital information such as car name, car number, availability status, and customer details. These are stored in **private** attributes with controlled access via **public methods**.

- **Abstraction:**  
  The `RentalSystem` class abstracts core functionalities such as booking, returning, and displaying car details, making it simple and intuitive to interact with.

- **Inheritance & Modularity:**  
  While the system does not directly use inheritance, its **modular design** ensures scalability. Future features, like pricing models or more advanced customer tracking, can be added without disrupting the existing structure.

- **Polymorphism:**  
  The system is designed to easily accommodate method overloading or overriding, ensuring flexibility for future extensions.
